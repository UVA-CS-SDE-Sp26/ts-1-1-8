//Purpose: The CipherTool deciphers encrypted mission files.It reads a cipher key from
ciphers/key.txt, validates that the key is properly structured, and uses that
key to translate ciphered text into readable text.

//Pseudocode
Constructor:
 - Create File object pointing to "ciphers/key.txt"
 - If file does not exist or is not a file
     - Throw IllegalArgumentException
 - Create BufferedReader
 - Read first line → assign to actual
 - Read second line → assign to cipher
 - Close reader
 - If either actual or cipher is null
     - Throw IllegalArgumentException
 - If actual.length != cipher.length
     - Throw IllegalArgumentException

 decipher(cipheredText):

 - If cipheredText is null
     - Return null
 - Create empty StringBuilder result
 - For each character in cipheredText
     - Find index of character in cipher string
     - If index == -1
         - Append original character to result
     - Else
         - Append actual.charAt(index) to result
 - Return result as String

 // Planned Tests
 1. Valid Decipher
 - Temporary key file created with known mapping
 - decipher("bca") returns "abc"

 2. Invalid Key Length
 - Temporary key file created with unequal line lengths
 - Constructor throws IllegalArgumentException

 3. Non-Mapped Characters
 - Input contains punctuation or spaces
 - Characters not found in cipher remain unchanged

 4. Key File Isolation
 - Original key.txt is saved before test
 - Temporary key written during test
 - Original key restored after test
