//Purpose
Programcontrol connects person B to person A

//tasks
-get a number and convert that to a file name
-get the files from dataFolder and make that into a list

Overview/methods:
-numToFile(int fileNum) is in charge of assigning the numbers to the files

-public String[] getFileList() receives and returns the list of files

-public String fileContents(int fileNum) returns what is in the file (reads what is in the file)

//Tests made:
-Make placebo files and make sure the NumToFiles works correctly
->does the number match the file it is supposed to

-make sure the files are received (getFiles works)
-> if there are 0 files there is an error, no files were arranged

-Make sure names were assigned to the files (testFileName)

-Test to make sure the file contents are valid
->using a stub I made the contents of filea.txt "A" and asserted equal that it is "A"
